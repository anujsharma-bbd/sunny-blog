As Drew Houston said, you only need to be right once, and sometimes we get there by accident—but it was our previous failures that got us to this point. Sometimes failure is a door to a breadth of exciting new opportunities. Don’t let it shut.

                           This ideology is booming these days, and for good reason. Consumers want companies to be transparent in their mission, vision, and operation practices. And the ones that are sincere, the ones that take their time to provide their customers with what they’ve been asking for are the ones that will stand the test of time. Remember: passion fuels desire.

As Kevin Plank explains, there’s never a good time, and waiting for it is a waste. Instead, learn to take a risk on something you believe in.The worst-case scenario? It doesn’t work.

                           No one knows everything. And no one should be expected to. There’s this idea out there, especially for the younger generation of workers, that professionals today need to know everything—but real knowledge is understanding that you can’t know everything.
We’re always improving, and the second we think we can stop is the second we need education the most. As Cher Wang says.

                           Similar to businesses thinking it’s okay to take their foot off the gas pedal, many brands get stuck in archaic business practices, ultimately hurting their company through their own means and misconceptions. The future doesn’t need to be scary, just as much as it doesn’t need to signal widespread organizational change in your business.
But they can’t keep referencing the past.

                           As a business leader, your job is to portray the qualities your employees and coworkers strive endlessly to replicate. Setting the right example is paramount if you want your business to follow in your footsteps. But if you want your company to follow you, you need to set the same expectations for yourself. Successful business leaders understand this, and their business cultures reflect this.
